# Robotics Course – Projects Overview

This repo contains three homework assignments and a final project for a mobile robotics course.  
Each folder has its own README with details and figures.

## Contents at a Glance

- **HW1 – Kinematics & Control**  
  Wheel-velocity cases, angle controller, and inverse kinematics with trajectory plots.  
  → See **HW1/README.md**.

- **HW2 – Localization & Mapping**  
  Compare GPS/Compass/Encoders on X–Y and θ–t; then build a hallway map and segment it (Split & Merge / IEPF).  
  → See **HW2/README.md**.

- **HW3 – Local Navigation (Bug Algorithms)**  
  Implement Bug0, Bug1, Bug2 (with stuck handling) to reach the door, then wall-follow to the target; includes metrics and trajectories.  
  → See **HW3/README.md**. 

- **Final Project – Indoor Mapping & Navigation**  
  **Phase 1:** Mavic wall-follows to map the apartment and logs door QR codes.  
  **Phase 2:** TurtleBot (no GPS/compass) uses particle filtering to localize and navigate to a selected door.  
  → See **Final Project/README.md**.
